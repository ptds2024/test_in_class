## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>, another possibility is to write this link as. @harrar2013taste

Here I want to write a mathematical expression: $y = X\beta + \epsilon$.

Here is the nice equation: $\chi = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{n_e}{n_{e,0}} - 1 \right)^2 + \left( \frac{z_f}{v_{z,0}} - 1 \right)^2 }$

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```


```{r}
lm(cars$speed ~ cars$dist)
```

```{r}
knitr::kable(iris[1:5,])
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=TRUE, fig.align='center'}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
